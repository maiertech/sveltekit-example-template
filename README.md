# sveltekit-example-template

This is a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) skeleton project which I use as a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to create repositories with SvelteKit examples. This repository has been created from the [official SvelteKit template](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit-template-default).

It adds configurations for [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) and [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io), i.e. any repository created from this template will run on both platforms without additional configuration. Both platforms will install dependencies automatically, run `npm run dev` and launch a preview.

StackBlitz projects can be [embedded in web pages](https://developer.stackblitz.com/docs/platform/embedding/), but [are currently not cross-browser compatible](https://developer.stackblitz.com/docs/platform/browser-support/).

You can also launch a SvelteKit project with these shortcuts (maintained by the good people at StackBlitz):

- skeleton SvelteKit project: https://node.new/sveltekit,
- example app project: https://sveltekit.new.
